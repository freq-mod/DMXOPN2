# DMXOPN2
No-nonsense patches for YM2612.

## About
Idk what to write here. Started as a better alternative to Wohlstand's gm.wopn bank, nowadays it will probably serve as a basis for sneakernets' upcoming DMXOPN2. 

Watch this space.

## Features

Nearly all Roland SC-55 melodic patches.
SC-55 drumkits - 90% complete
SFXs - work started, don't expect miracles
SC-88Pro/XG/GM2 support is planned.

## Issues

Choirs are hollow, percussion is quiet, cymbals barely resemble what they're supposed to be, etc... This is a single-chip FM synthesizer from 1987, after all.
